                        An article written by the <a href="https://cpag.org.uk/news/there-only-so-much-we-can-do-school-staff-england">Child Poverty Action Group</a> has uncovered that in the UK, the pervasive issue of child poverty affects approximately 4.2 million children, equivalent to around 9 students in a typical class of 30. A concerning survey underscores the escalating problem within schools, with the consequences of poverty becoming an increasingly formidable challenge. The impact of poverty diverts the attention of school staff from their primary educational responsibilities, creating a strain beyond their expertise. Alarming statistics indicate that 79% of school staff experience a reduction in time and capacity for other aspects of their roles due to child poverty, while 74% observe students in poverty falling behind academically. Moreover, 80% believe that providing universal free school meals could alleviate child poverty. The repercussions extend beyond students, as schools grappling with funding cuts face significant issues such as staff shortages, building failures, and inadequate support for students requiring special education.

                        <br><br>Furthermore, a Research Article conducted by the <a href="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/media/5a80cc78e5274a2e87dbbe1c/Progress_at_Secondary_School_report_final.pdf">UK Government</a> has unveiled that in Key Stage 2 (KS2), students experiencing poverty demonstrate slower progress, even with high attainment, compared to their more affluent peers with similar prior achievements. Research conducted by Shaw et al reveals a widening gap since 2012, as students from all ethnic backgrounds not eligible for free school meals (FSM) make faster progress in secondary school than their FSM-eligible counterparts. In terms of GCSE progress, FSM pupils make between 0.26 and 0.35 of a grade less compared to their counterparts with similar KS2 attainment, while non-FSM pupils make between 0.06 and 0.09 of a grade more progress. Factors influencing this disparity include variations in treatment within schools based on FSM status, including setting, curriculum options, and teacher allocation, as well as significant differences in home environments affecting academic performance. Notably, the impact of FSM eligibility outweighs the effect of area deprivation, with non-FSM pupils in the most deprived areas making more progress on average than FSM-eligible students in the least deprived areas. The gap between FSM and non-FSM pupils is most pronounced in rural areas and least in urban areas, attributed to FSM pupils making less progress in rural settings, while non-FSM pupils demonstrate more progress in rural compared to urban areas. Regardless of prior attainment, low-income pupils eligible for FSM consistently make less progress than their non-FSM counterparts at secondary school, indicating a pervasive challenge that extends beyond academic achievement.

                        <br><br>Additionally, a blog conducted by <a href="https://www.graygroupintl.com/blog/education-for-the-poor">Gray Group International</a> has revealed that the profound educational gap faced by children stems from the unequal distribution of resources and opportunities, with those forced to live in poverty being particularly susceptible. Schools grappling with underfunding and resource scarcity, often attended by impoverished children, struggle to provide essential learning materials, technology, and extracurricular activities crucial for a comprehensive learning experience. Long distances to school pose transportation challenges for students, hindering access to education. Additionally, financial constraints may lead impoverished children to prioritise work over learning, adversely affecting academic achievement.

                        <br><br>Limited access to healthcare and nutrition further impedes academic success, as health issues may hinder attendance and concentration. Unstable home environments, exacerbated by issues like 'lack of stable housing,' 'food insecurity,' and 'exposure to violence,' detrimentally impact a child's academic progress. To address these challenges, providing essential free school meals emerges as a potential solution to alleviate the stress of poverty and enable students to focus on their education without the burden of hunger.

                        <br><br>Efforts to tackle poverty should extend to comprehensive healthcare support, including vaccinations, free health checkups, and access to healthcare professionals. Such initiatives aim to improve overall student well-being and significantly boost attendance. Moreover, effective mental health support is crucial in mitigating the adverse effects of poverty. Offering students access to free mental health services provides a safe space for emotional expression and assistance in navigating the challenges associated with poverty, ultimately enhancing their well-being and learning outcomes.
                        <img src="/images/nhs-logo-880x4951.jpeg">

                        <br><br>In addition to this, a study that was conducted by the <a href="https://www.healthscotland.scot/media/2186/child-poverty-impact-inequalities-2018.pdf">NHS Scotland</a> has uncovered that children from lower-income households face disparities in cognitive development, school achievement, and social-behavioural outcomes compared to their more affluent peers. This lack of cognitive development directly hampers educational progress and learning outcomes, particularly evident in students from households earning less than the average income. The UK Millennium Cohort Study indicates that children born into poverty exhibit significantly lower school test scores at ages 3, 5, and 7, highlighting a correlation between poverty and poorer academic performance.

                        <br><br>Recent evidence suggests that growing up in poverty has a developmental impact on brain structure, affecting areas responsible for language, executive function, and memory. The Scottish Cohort Study on health inequalities in early years underscores the substantial knowledge and problem-solving gaps between children from higher and lower-income families at the age of five. In the first year of primary school, there is a notable rise in the proportion of students attaining early-level Curriculum for Excellence (CfE) across reading, writing, and numeracy, with variations based on deprivation levels.
                        <img src="/images/childbrain.jpg">

                        <br><br>Among S2 children, performance well in reading, writing, listening, talking, and numeracy shows significant disparities based on regional deprivation levels. The contrast extends to school leavers, where the percentage achieving SVQ level 6 qualifications or higher is notably higher in the least deprived areas compared to the most deprived, emphasising the profound impact of socio-economic disparities on educational outcomes.

                        <br><br>Moreover, in an article written by <a href="https://scholarworks.merrimack.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1030&context=honors_component">Merrimack College</a>, it highlights how according to the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA), approximately 50 million people nationwide are grappling with food insecurity, with 87% of households with children under 18 facing this issue in 2022. Children raised in low-income households, exceeding 90%, encounter challenges in speech, learning, and emotional development. Students from economically disadvantaged backgrounds typically demonstrate lower levels of verbal and reasoning skills compared to their more affluent peers.

                        <br><br>Insufficient food or proper nutrition can disrupt a child's learning, causing stomach pains and persistent worries about financial issues or securing their next meal. Poverty and food insecurity increase the risk of students becoming targets for bullying, adversely impacting mental well-being and motivation to excel. Additionally, these challenges may compel children to shoulder complex responsibilities, intensifying stress and the likelihood of developing mental health issues. This, in turn, diminishes their time for schoolwork, social interaction, and exploring personal interests and hobbies.

                        <br><br>Studies indicate that malnourished children exhibit smaller brains compared to their age group's typical size, attributed to diminished myelination and inadequate intake of essential protein and calories. Myelination, crucial for brain connectivity, aids in the development of cognitive and behavioural functions, resulting in challenges in IQ, language, and fine motor development.

                        <br><br>Recent research underscores that children from low socioeconomic backgrounds possess significantly less grey matter in the frontal and parietal lobes than their peers from higher-income families. This discrepancy negatively affects a child's capacity to learn and excel in academic performance, highlighting the profound impact of poverty and food insecurity on cognitive development and educational outcomes.

                        <br><br>What’s more, a study conducted by <a href="https://www.cam.ac.uk/research/news/poor-children-are-being-failed-by-the-system-on-road-to-higher-education-in-lower-income-countries">Cambridge University</a> has uncovered that children with similar abilities at the age of 8 show a significant disparity in tertiary education entry based on wealth, with the wealthiest children being more than 30 percentage points likelier than their least-wealthy counterparts to pursue various forms of tertiary education, including university, technical colleges, and teacher training. Even among students who successfully complete secondary school with similar academic achievements, those from more affluent backgrounds still exhibit a higher likelihood of advancing to higher education.

                        <br><br>In a 'Young Lives' study focusing on those born in 1994/95, researchers found that the percentage point gap between the poorest 25% and wealthiest 25% entering higher education was 45 in both India and Peru, 41 in Vietnam, and 17 in Ethiopia. Children from poor backgrounds often face challenges progressing due to dropout rates or underachievement throughout primary and secondary school.
                        <img src="/images/welathdiff.png">

                        <br><br>High-promise children from the richest quartile are more likely to enter higher education compared to their poorest counterparts, with a percentage point gap of 39 in Peru, 32 in India and Vietnam, and 15 in Ethiopia. The study recommends addressing the wealth gap in higher education by focusing on targeted investments in primary education for the most economically disadvantaged, such as offering free school meals, providing free healthcare, or delivering free mental health support to students living in poverty. Implementing such changes in their daily lives could significantly improve academic performance and overall quality of life.

                        <br><br>The persistent wealth gap among individuals completing secondary school highlights the need for initiatives to lower the expenses of higher education for disadvantaged students. The study suggests means-tested grants as a potential solution, emphasising the necessity for additional evidence to substantiate this approach.

                        An article written by the <a href="https://cpag.org.uk/news/there-only-so-much-we-can-do-school-staff-england">Child Poverty Action Group</a> has deduced that in order to address these challenges, school staff propose immediate steps for the government, such as expanding free school meals, increasing financial support for low and middle-income families, and providing assistance with school-related costs like uniforms and trips. According to 80% of school staff, implementing universal free school meals for all children is seen as a crucial measure to alleviate child poverty within schools. Beyond its impact on students, poverty-induced issues, including funding cuts, staff shortages, building failures, and inadequate support for special education, further strain the educational system. Teachers emphasise the need for comprehensive government action to mitigate child poverty's effects and enable students to concentrate on their education.

Offering free mental health support provides students with a safe space to express emotions and receive assistance in dealing with the challenges posed by poverty. This support not only enhances their well-being but also contributes to improved learning outcomes.
